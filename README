Notes on Conjoint Experiment Tool:

The xlsx survey is written for software that uses ODK (open source).  Our survey was implemented in SurveyCTO specifically.  

Note that the calculations for random allocation of dimensions become increasingly complicated with more options for attributes.
In our example, dimensions 1, 2, and 4 have only two potential attributes each, making the random assignment relatively straightforward.
Dimension 3 has 3 attributes - pay close attention to how this is calculated.  Increasing the number of attributes would greatly
increase the effort needed to calculate the random assignment.

The file attributes.csv and the images in the 'small images' folder accompany the survey.


Notes on the Social Network Tool:

The protocol uses a file type which is used by Network Canvas: https://www.networkcanvas.com/
Their website has extensive documentation which can assist in designing your own survey.
