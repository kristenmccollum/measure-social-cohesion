NOTES ON CODING AND INCLUSION:
For each study, I coded the data source (primary, secondary, or both), the description of the indicators used and (when possible) their corresponding option choices.  
I categorized these into 7 different dimensions which were principally chosen based on how the indicators best sorted themselves.  
However, the dimensions largely resemble those identified in Valli, Peterman, and Hidrobo (2019), with some additions.

A few caveats: the call for papers included research related to forced displacement and social cohesion, which means some papers explore mediators of, or linkages to, social cohesion, 
rather than the concept itself.  In these cases, the indicators were not included in the database or resulting categorization.  
Notes on these coding decisions are documented below.


Did not include indicators on labor market outcomes, even though these were very common across papers	
	Reasoning is because this can be conceptualized more as a mediator (or perhaps consequence) of social cohesion rather than a dimension of it
  
Did not include access to social services or quality of social services, though this appears occasionally	
Did not include income inequality or poverty measures	
Did not include educational enrollment/attainment measures	

Some indicators could have spanned more than one dimension.  In these cases, I chose one and used it consistently.  	
	Example: Coded 'voting' as trust in institutions, though it could be considered social participation as well.
  
In total, 21 of the 26 papers were included for this review of measurement	
	9 used primary data; 13 use secondary data (one uses both)
	19 use singular indicators, 1 uses conjoint experiment and 1 uses lab-in-the-field
